        <p> The advent of webpage creation tools such as squarespace, wix, and wordpress has generally homogenized the web.
            In opposition to this, i've decided to spend my spare time creating a more unique form of expression on the internet, both as a homage and a challenge to myself, as so much of modern web design tools are suited for flat design. 
            Taking inspiration from early to mid 2000s blogs and forums, I hope to hone my HTML and CSS skills, to allow myself to make stylized websites outside of the corporate memphis styled aesthetics of the modern web.
            I am actively seeking inspiration for this website. If you find some unique web artifact, feel free to email me a link at eyanaszaszko@gmail.com.
        </p>
    
        <p> In addition to this, I have yet to create a purpose for this site. 
            I don't particularly have any idea on what I want to do here, maybe just post a bit about my adventures and exploits in my own quiet way, 
            just cataloging things that happened to me or things i've been interested in.
        </p>
    
        <p> To start, I just recently finished Kamen Rider Kuuga, and have moved onto Geats which is at about episode 30 right now.</p>
